Amino Build Script Example

This directory contains example build scripts to compile and link
against the Amino libraries.  It will build a scenegraph for the
Baxter robot.

Make
====

The file `Makefile.example` contains an example makefile.  To use:

1. Set the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH to point to the directory containg the
   `baxter_description` package.  (You must change the path for your
   system.)

       export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=PATH/TO/ROS/PACKAGES

2. Make using the example makefile:

       make -f Makefile.example

3. Run:

       ./baxter-simple

CMake
=====

The file `CMakeLists.txt` contains an example CMake script.  To use:

1. Set the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH to point to the directory containg the
   `baxter_description` package.  (You must change the path for your
   system.)

       export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=PATH/TO/ROS/PACKAGES

2. Create a build directory:

       mkdir build

3. Change to the build direct:

       cd ./build

4. Call cmake to generate the Makefile:

       cmake ..

5. Make using the cmake-generate makefile:

       make

5. Run:

       ./baxter-simple
